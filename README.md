# Simon Says Game

A simple memory game where the player repeats a sequence of colors that grows with each level. The game uses DOM manipulation to flash buttons, display the current level, and give visual feedback for correct or wrong moves. Users click the colored buttons to match the sequence, and a wrong click ends the game. Press any key to start or restart the game. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
